\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{chp:conclusion}

We have designed and implemented a type system of \qub{}, based on logic of \BI{}.
It offers a nice conglomeration of \textbf{HM} type system and intuitionistic linear type system and is more
expressive than existing type systems by statically tracking resources.
We have a prototype implementation of \qub{} is based on Habit\citep{apoorv_qub_2018}.

Sub-structural type system are an active area of research.
The \qub{} type inference is incomplete as terms can have two incomparable types depending
on the predicates and the context of the function. We would want to have a clear way of solving
the dilemma and be able to detect appropriate types automatically in the type inference algorithm.
We have not given any formal semantic model for our language to rigorously prove soundness with respect to original
system of logic of \BI{} and neither have we tried to analyze the system with respect to categorical models.
It will be worth while to pursue them from a theoretical perspective.
