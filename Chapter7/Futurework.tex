\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{chp:conclusion}

We have explored type system of \qub{}, based on sub-structural logic of \BI{}.
It offers a nice conglomeration of \textbf{HM} type system and intuitionistic linear type system and is more
expressive than existing type system in terms of statically tracking resources.


For future work we have quite a few areas to explore and which need deeper understanding.
The \qub{} type inference is incomplete with respect to the fact that terms can have two types depending
on the predicates and the context of the function. We would want to have a clear way of solving
the dilemma and be able to detect it automatically in the type inference algorithm.
We have not given any formal semantic models for our language to rigorously prove the soundness with respect to original
system of logic of \BI{} and neither have we tried to analyze the system with respect to categorical models.
It will be worth while to pursue them from a theoretical perspective.
