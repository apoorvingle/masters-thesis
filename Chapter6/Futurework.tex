missing pieces here.

We have not given any sematic model for our language. The typing context can be thought
of as to generate a sharing graph. It is similar to a separating graph in $\lambda_{sep}$ \citep{atkey_lambda_sep_2004}
automoatic detection of  addtitive and multiplicative types using polymorphism
we assume that polymorphism does not affect our case becuase the resources we use
are monoic types. We may have to incorporate work on polymorphism \cite{collinson_bunched_2005} for
more generalized setting.
