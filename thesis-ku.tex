  What am i doing here?
  Make Quill work. Write programs in them and check and see
  how painful it is.

  Quill is a purely functional language that uses
  qualified types to keep track of resources.
  We introduce a new type class to express unrestrictedness
  of a type, define the degree of unrestrictedness of classes
  and a concept of sharing or separation of closures for functions

% How to use these files.

% \textbf{Step 1. Study the features in this document.} Please read
% through this Abstract. It is intended to be readable, pleasant, welcoming
% and helpful. The PDF you are reading was created by compiling thesis-ku.tex.
% After you finish inspecting this document, then look at the LaTeX
% document from which it came. 

% \textbf{Step 2. Inspect the LaTeX source code that is provided in
% the same package as the PDF document.}

% There are some special features that will become apparent once you
% look at the LaTeX source code. The thesis-ku document is the ``master''
% document. The separate chapters are in separate folders. It is possible
% to work on one chapter at a time, and compile just that chapter, or
% it is possible to compile the whole thing by compiling the master
% document.

% In thesis-ku, we have included as many bells and whistles as possible
% so that users can see how the different features can be put to use.
% We have a BibTeX bibliography, graphs, equations, cross references,
% table of contents, and all of the other interesting features.

% The most recently inserted feature is support for hyperlinks in the
% PDF output. We checked with the KU Graduate Dean's office and they
% said there is no policy prohibiting the use of hyperlinks, but there
% is also no guarantee from the dissertation hosting institution that
% they will either work or not cause problems down the line. We believe
% there is not too much danger here, this feature is easy to turn off
% if need be. Also, it is not entirely clear what color the links must
% be inside the document, so we take a conservative step here of making
% the links black, so they appear as simple text. The default settings
% for the \texttt{hyperref} package, which we have altered, caused ugly
% pink links with gross looking boxes around them. Users can change
% the link color to blue. It is fairly easy to see how this can be done
% in the document preamble. Look for something like this ``\texttt{urlcolor=\{black\},citecolor=\{black\},allcolors=\{black\}''}
% and think of Henry Ford's famous comment, ``You can have a car in
% any color you like, as long as its black.'' 

% \textbf{Step 3. Try to compile the thesis-ku document!} Before you
% try to edit this and enhance it (and put your name on it), please
% \textbf{STOP}! Recompile this document exactly as it is. This will
% force you to test your LaTeX setup. Unzip the collection, consider
% installing the class file as described below, then try to compile
% \texttt{thesis-ku}. That zipped collection has everything in the right
% places, don't re-arrange directories yet. Until you reproduce the
% PDF you are reading now, you are not ready to start making changes.
% People often come forward with questions and our first question for
% them is ``did you compile (without error) \texttt{thesis-ku.tex}?''
% Until we hear those people say ``yes'', we are generally unable
% to help with their revised documents. That's the only way we will
% know if your \LaTeX{} setup is ready to go. 

% \emph{If you have used \LaTeX{}}, you will find this more or less
% self explanatory. There's a \LaTeX{} file ``\texttt{thesis-ku.tex}''.
% It is a ``master'' document, it links together the content of several
% files. Compile that with \texttt{\textbf{pdflatex}}. The class file
% that makes this go, ``\texttt{kuthesis.cls}'', is saved in the current
% working directory. It is not necessary to install it into your broader
% \LaTeX{} distribution, but you can if you like. One reason to install
% kuthesis.cls in your larger setup is to silence warnings from editors
% that don't remember to look in your current directory. If you install
% \texttt{kuthesis.cls} in your system, you don't need to keep a copy
% of it with your dissertation. That may be convenient.

% \emph{If you have never used \LaTeX{}}, we will tell you how to compile
% this document. But, before you try, can we give you a warning: \emph{please
% don't make writing your dissertation your first \LaTeX{} project}.
% Start with some simpler example documents. Write some letters to your
% loved ones, experiment a little bit. In the KU Center for Research
% Methods and Data Analysis, there are occasional workshops for people
% who want to get started with \LaTeX{}. There are many ``how to get
% started with \LaTeX{}'' websites. Ours is \url{http://crmda.ku.edu/latex}.

% If you have never used LaTeX before, a good way to start is with the
% editor named LyX. Instead of editing the ``raw'' LaTeX file \texttt{thesis-ku.tex},
% use LyX to edit \texttt{thesis-ku.lyx}. There is a separate section
% below about using LyX.

% \textbf{Step 4. Customize This and Write a Dissertation.}
% This PDF document is produced from a source document. If you are using
% a \LaTeX{} editor like TexShop, Tex Works, or \TeX{} Studio, the
% source document you need to edit and compile is ``\texttt{thesis-ku.tex}.''
% If you plan to use \LyX{}, the place to start is by opening ``\texttt{thesis-ku.lyx}''
% in \LyX{}'s editor. This document was prepared with version 2.1 and,
% if you are using an older version, you should update.

% The first user customization is to insert your name and the names
% of some committee members. The document has a top section called a
% ``preamble.'' (If using \LyX{}, click the Document menu, then Settings,
% and look down). In the preamble, you will find the following block:

% \inputencoding{latin9}\begin{lstlisting}[tabsize=4]
% % Set the title and author info
% \title{Resource Aware purely functional language}
% \author{Apoorv Inge}

% \dept{Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}
% \degreetitle{Master of Science}
% \papertype{Thesis} %or Thesis
%% It is vital to have 7 entries, so leave the empty place holders {} even 
%% if some of the committee and role lines are to remain empty
% \committee{MEMBER 1}{MEMBER 2}{MEMBER 3}{MEMBER 4}{The One with an Extra Long Name}{The Fifth Beatle}{}
% \role{Chairperson}{Occasional Visitor}{}{The One Who Never Answers Email}{}{}{}
% \end{lstlisting}
% \inputencoding{utf8}
% Here you see the most important template updates for October, 2015.
% We have newly enhanced \texttt{\textbackslash{}committee} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}role}
% environments. Now, we allow users to specify up to 7 committee members
% and each one can have a different role. Why provide all of this luxury?
% There were unexpected requests from students. The original KU Thesis
% template had only ``Chair'' for the first member. Users asked for
% a secondary title ``Co-Chair'' for member 2. Then they wanted to
% change the title of the first member to ``Lead Chair''. Then they
% wanted to add a the third Co-Chair, and so forth. 

% Now we accommodate those requests by leaving blank spots for up to
% seven committee members and seven roles. It is vital for you to leave
% the blank place holders \{\} if you don't want to list additional
% members or roles. This example document shows some funny titles, we
% do that only to prove it is possible. Generally, there is only a Chair,
% possibly a Co-Chair. This example has more roles in this example for
% fun. Or to make fun of a professor. You can change them to \{\}, of
% course, if you don't want a named role.

% The other thing to change is the date section. Lower in the preamble,
% you should see a place to insert some dates. Originally, we told students
% ``just write those dates in by hand, like we did back in the olden
% days.'' But they kept saying they wanted them type set, so here they
% are. If a date is currently unknown, just leave a blank inside the
% brackets
% \inputencoding{latin9}\begin{lstlisting}
% \datedefended{June 11, 2018}
% \dateapproved{June 11, 2018}
% \end{lstlisting}
% \inputencoding{utf8}
% After you make those changes in the preamble, compile the document.

% \textbf{How to Configure your LaTeX Distribution with kuthesis.cls}

% I wish we had packaged \texttt{kuthesis.cls} into an official LaTeX
% distribution package so that it could be easily installed by your
% distribution. We did not do that, however, and so it is up to you
% to place a copy of \texttt{kuthesis.cls} in the right spot\texttt{.}
% This is not truly necessary. Programs like pdflatex will find \texttt{kuthesis.cls}
% if you have it in the same directory as the document. I believe, with
% 97.5\% confidence, it will find \texttt{kuthesis.cls} if you keep
% it in the same directory as your document. If you want to use kuthesis.cls
% for several documents, it is necessary to install ``\texttt{kuthesis.cls}''
% into your \LaTeX{} file structure. That is generally an easy process,
% but it is different on every type of computer. The CRMDA staff has
% recently prepared a guide for this, entitled ``How Users can Install
% \LaTeX{} packages without Help from System Administrators'' (\url{https://crmda.ku.edu/guide-32-latex_config}).
% The gist of this is as follows:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Copy ``\texttt{kuthesis.cls}'' into a directory in your \LaTeX{}
% distribution. Usually (almost always), you will find a directory component
% that ends in ``tex/latex'' and you can put kuthesis.cls in there.
% The only puzzle is finding the right place, and that's why you should
% review our guide.{\small \par}
% \item Run ``texhash'' or to make the \LaTeX{} distribution take notice
% of your new file. On Mac and Linux systems, open a terminal and run
% ``\texttt{sudo texhash}'' to get this done as the administrator.{\small \par}
% \end{enumerate}
% \textbf{How to Get Started on this with \LyX{}}

% This document with \LyX{}! It will work. LyX is a pleasant-to-use
% editor, it can protect you from some of the details that ordinary
% \LaTeX{} will present. \LyX{} is free to use on all major computing
% platforms, including Linux, Macintosh, and Windows. \LyX{} can be
% downloaded at \url{http://www.lyx.org}. To make this work, LaTeX
% programs are also needed. 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Mac users: install the ``MacTeX'' package (\url{https://www.tug.org/mactex}). {\small \par}
% \item Linux users: install your distribution's version of TeXLive or install
% the TeXLive files from the TeXLive website (\url{https://www.tug.org/texlive})
% . {\small \par}
% \item Windows Users: The LyX website offers 2 choices, a LyX-only package
% and an ``installer bundle'' that includes LyX along with a small
% subset of the MikTeX LaTeX distribution. This installs just a small
% subset of MikTeX and pieces can be separately downloaded when needed.
% In Fall, 2016, we had some difficulties during a LaTeX workshop because
% the MikTeX package server was unavailable. As a result, we have been
% migrating away from MikTeX (and the LyX installer bundle) to use TeXLive
% for Windows (\url{https://www.tug.org/texlive}). That's a big 2GB
% package like MacTeX, after that we install the LyX program. If you
% choose the MikTeX setup instead, it will usually be fine, but users
% often complain that LyX seems to ``freeze'' when it downloads new
% MikTeX components.{\small \par}
% \end{enumerate}
%
% {\small \par}If you install a LaTeX distribution and LyX, then you can open the
% file ``thesis-ku.lyx''. At the very beginning, a couple of horrible
% warnings appear. These warnings look like this:

% \begin{tabular}{cc}
% \includegraphics[width=2in]{images/lyx-nolayout} & \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{images/lyx-noclsfile}\tabularnewline
% \end{tabular}

% We will explain how to eliminate these warnings, but you can ignore
% them for the moment. Just click ``OK'' 5 or 6 times. After that,
% you will find that the dissertation document can be compiled (even
% though there were horrible scary warnings). To compile the document,
% either click on the ``googly eyes'' icon in the toolbar or use the
% keyboard shortcut ``Ctl-R''. If your system has a PDF viewer installed
% and LyX can find it, all will be well. We are warned by Windows 10
% users that Microsoft has made the Web browser ``Edge'' the default
% PDF viewer and that does not work well with LyX. We recommend installing
% the PDF viewer Sumatra (\url{https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html})
% and then using the Windows configuration to set Sumatra as the default
% PDF viewer.

% Why does \LyX{} work? When the user asks \LyX{} to preview the PDF
% output, a two step process happens behind the scenes. A file named
% ``\texttt{thesis-ku.tex}'' is created in a temporary directory,
% and then a program like \texttt{\textbf{pdflatex}} is asked to turn
% that into a PDF document. \LyX{} will then send the PDF output to
% a PDF viewer, such as Yapp, Evince or Acrobat.

% How to silence the LyX warnings.

% \noindent \textbf{1. Copy the LyX layout file ``}\texttt{\textbf{kuthesis.layout}}\textbf{''
% into the layout folder of the user configuration.}

% The only problem is finding the correct user configuration folder.

% {\small \par}\begin{description}
% \item [{On~Linux,}] copy \texttt{kuthesis.layout} into the user HOME folder,
% under ``\texttt{.lyx/layouts}''. {\small \par}
% \item [{On~Windows,}] there is a hidden AppData directory inside the user's
% home folder. How to find it? Run \LyX{}. A window should appear with
% a row of pull down menus at the top. Choose Tools/Preferences. Change
% something trivial, then close the menu. That will force \LyX{} to
% create a user folder. Then search inside your user directory for a
% key word such as ``lyxrc.defaults''. Probably, searching for ``{*}lyx{*}''
% will be sufficient. In MS Windows 7, I found ``C:\textbackslash{}Users\textbackslash{}pauljohn\textbackslash{}AppData\textbackslash{}Roaming\textbackslash{}lyx212\textbackslash{}layouts''.
% Caution: The AppData folder is hidden/concealed and, in order to find
% it in Windows Explorer, it is necessary to change the folder options
% to NOT hide protected files and folders. Windows 10 is very similar.{\small \par}
% \item [{On~Macintosh~OS~X,}] we recently followed same ``change a setting,
% then search'' procedure. The answer was ``/Users/pauljohn/Library/Application
% Support/\LyX{}-2.1/layouts''. Documentation for OS X El Capitan
% indicates that Apple has followed the Microsoft policy of hiding this
% folder, so the person who uses the Finder will have to change some
% preferences to show the directory.{\small \par}
% \end{description}
% \textbf{2. Copy the LaTeX class file ``}\texttt{\textbf{kuthesis.cls}}\textbf{''
% into the LaTeX distribution and then do the appropriate reconfiguration. }

% Again, if you have done this before, it is no big deal. If you have
% not done it before, it seems daunting. We described it in an earlier,
% under the heading \textbf{How to Configure your LaTeX Distribution
% with kuthesis.cls}. 

% \noindent \textbf{3. Let LyX find your changes.}

% \noindent In LyX, find the pull down menu item Tools -> Reconfigure. 

% After that, LyX should work and not warn you about files it thinks
% it does not have. Once again, it is not necessary to do these reconfigurations,
% but LyX will not warn about missing pieces anymore.

% We notice that LyX is not, by default, configured to do spell-checking
% as you type. This is a vestigial setting, a reflection of the days
% long ago when people knew how to spell. To turn on the spell checker,
% use the pull down menu \texttt{Tools} -> \texttt{Preferences} -> \texttt{Language
% Settings} -> \texttt{Spellchecker}. One must choose a program to serve
% as the ``Spellchecker engine'' and then click ``Spellcheck Continously''.
% The Spellchecker engine I use in Ubuntu Linux is called Enchant. I
% expect you will find one in your operating system, or can find one.
% If not, we may have to ask Mr. Google for help.

% \textbf{Other friendly advice.}

% \emph{Compile Early, Compile Often}

% The truly bad part of using \LaTeX{} is that the errors and warnings
% are, generally, not understandable. They are not understandable to
% me and I've been using \LaTeX{} for about 20 years. I mean, well,
% they are simply too abstract. Too complicated. If you insert an illegal
% character, such as an ``\_'' in a \LaTeX{} box, the document will
% fail with this unhelpful message

% \inputencoding{latin9}\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true,tabsize=2]
% Missing $ inserted.
% Missing $ inserted.
% Missing } inserted.
% Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
% ...
% I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
% \end{lstlisting}
% \inputencoding{utf8}
% \noindent At best, the message will point to the line you inserted
% to cause the problem, but often the \LaTeX{} system cannot guess
% where your mistake is, it can only say something is wrong. The best
% way to defend yourself: \textbf{\textit{Compile Early, Compile Often}}\textbf{.
% }Don't make a lot of changes without trying to compile. It is easy
% to insert a feature that breaks the document. Compile often so you
% know when things have gone wrong. 

% \emph{Use a Version Management System!}

% If this is an important project, please consider installing Git or
% some other version management program. It is difficult to avoid clutter
% if you have to rename your file every day. I see user directories
% full of files named, ``my\_diss.lyx'', ``my\_diss.2.lyx'', ``my\_diss\_final.lyx'',
% ``my\_diss\_rejected.lyx'' and so forth. It is very difficult to
% keep old and new versions straight unless you use a version manager.
% A version manager will handle that for you. You will just have one
% file ``my\_diss.lyx'' and you will have the ability to compare old
% and new snapshots. The CRMDA has a more-or-less comprehensive, yet
% easy to follow guide for Git, ``Git it Together''.

% I urge you to keep your \LaTeX{} document in Git so you can make
% frequent commits and it will be easy to step back in time. This is
% one reason why you should work on separate chapters, so if you break
% something, then you are more likely to find your mistakes.

% \emph{KU requires that fonts be compiled with the final result}

% The pdflatex compiler will insert fonts when it compiles the document.
% However, there is a ``gotcha''. If you create PDF documents separately,
% and you forget to embed the fonts with them, then the KU Graduate
% Dean's office is likely to reject your thesis. When a PDF is included
% within this document, pdflatex does not check to see if fonts are
% embedded in those PDFs. It assumes they are as you want them; fonts
% for those included files are not automatically inserted by pdflatex.
% When a graph, for example, is created in R and exported to PDF, it
% will not include the font encodings by default. It is possible to
% add those encodings. Little details like this come up from time to
% time and we make note of them in \url{https://crmda.ku.edu/latex-help}.

% \emph{If you need help, ask, but please understand }

% I don't have as much time as I would like to help users. I want you
% to use \LaTeX{}. I think doing anything else is finger painting.
% I've watched 20 MA and PhD theses written with this template and I
% know a bright student will succeed and be happy with the result. If
% you have a laptop computer and you want to show me some errors, I
% can give you 5 or 10 minutes. But not much more... 

% CRMDA offers some workshops and I teach graduate courses in which
% we show how to use \LaTeX{}. If you find something wrong with kuthesis.cls,
% I will be glad to try to fix it. 

% I don't have time/ability to answer a million email questions about
% \LaTeX{} or \LyX{}. If you are stuck on a tough problem, I may be
% able to help, but if I have to exert myself, you should know I expect
% you to give me a t-shirt and/or add me to the acknowledgements in
% your dissertation.
