\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  Modern programming languages treat resources as normal values.
  They have different semantics at runtime that does not match with its static
  semantics. For example, file handles or database connections are treated as integers
  in C. Modern functional programming languages like Haskell try to improve this
  by wrapping them in IO monads. While it is an improvement over imperative languages,
  well typed programs may have runtime errors. Type systems based on linear logic[\cite{girard_linear_1987}]
  promise a way to introduce the efficient resource handling in programs.
  %There have been numerous attempts to make use of linear logic in programming languages.
  %It has made its way into some parts of programming languages
  %such as garbage collectors and also type systems (Rust and Clean).
  While the these is more expressive than intuistionistic logic, there are various practical issues
  that prohibit leveraging it to its fullest degree in programming languages.
  In this thesis, we take a different view over the resource management problem by concentrating
  on sharing or separation of resources which been studied in a theoritical
  setting as the logic of bunched implications (\BI)[\cite{ohearn_logic_1999}].

  We design and implement \qub, a prototype language that is Curry-Howard interpretation of the logic
  based on \BI\ [\cite{ohearn_bunched_2003}]---$\alpha\lambda$-calculus---by introducing 2 new type
  constructors of arrow type: sharing arrow ($\rightarrow$) and separating arrow($\sepimp$) to replace
  the usual notion of function arrows of simply typed lambda calculus. Sharing arrows imply that functions
  share resources with its arguments, while separating arrows imply that functions do not share resources with its arguments.
  We base our work on Quill [\cite{morris_best_2016}] which express linear types in a functional language.
  We realize that the interaction of unrestricted types and sharing and separating is harmless as program entities that
  do not have a sense of resourcefulness can be duplicated or dropped anytime without
  any adverse implications and all existing programs typecheck.
  % haivng unrestricted types
  % are realizations of existing purely functional programs.

  % Complexity of software systems has been increasing forever. Automation of tasks
  % provides consistency, correctness and speed at a much greater degree than humans.
  % complex software systems find their use in various fields ranging from automobiles, aircrafts,
  % financial institutions and even medicine. Higher level programming languages
  % are used to program these software systems and developing them requires
  % adequate understanding of the programming language along with problem domain.
  % Structured programming techniques ensures maintanability and extensibility
  % of the software application. Types and functional programming style helps maintain
  % structure by making it possible to run algorithmic checks to ensure sanity.
  % I have no idea what I am talking about. TODO! get back on track

  %  What is quil?
  % Quill is a purely functional language that uses
  % qualified types and a varient of linear logic to keep track of resources.
  % We introduce a new type class to express unrestrictedness
  % of a type, define the degree of unrestrictedness of classes
  % and a concept of sharing or separation of closures for functions

  % What am I trying to doing here?
  % Make Quill work. Write programs in them and check and see
  % how painful it is.
  % We realize that we have 2 kinds of pairs, a sharing pair and a separating pair depending
  % on the arrow we use. We try to formalize other structures such as Lists, non-empty lists
  % datatypes (recursive and non-recursive) and type classes such as functor, applicative and
  % monads with specific instances of each.
